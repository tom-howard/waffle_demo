    "# Using a TurtleBot3 Waffle with ROS\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting started\n",
    "\n",
    "### Notes\n",
    "**1:** *When using ROS you will need to have several Linux Terminal Windows running simultaneously.  Only close down terminals or shut down processes (using `CTRL+C`) when instructed to do so otherwise your robot may not run!*  \n",
    "**2:** *Any text `in a grey box` below is a command that you should enter in the terminal to launch a ROS process, enter all of the text*  \n",
    "**3:** *You can copy the text from here using `CTRL+C`, but to paste it into the terminal you will need to use `CTRL+SHIFT+V`*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, make sure that the robot is turned on via the switch on the front\n",
    "1. Make sure the laptop is connected to the *DIA-LAB* WiFi network  \n",
    "1. Open a terminal window on the laptop by using the `CTRL+ALT+T` keyboard shortcut.  We'll refer to this as **[TERMINAL 1]**.  \n",
    "1. Enter the following to establish a connection to your robot via ssh:  \n",
    "**[TERMINAL 1]:** `ssh waffle@dia-waffleX`  \n",
    "where `X` is the number of the robot as printed on the top.  Enter the password when requested (we'll provide this separately)\n",
    "1. The terminal prompt should then change as follows:  \n",
    "        waffle@dia-waffleX:~$  \n",
    "which indicates that we are now logged in to a *\"remote terminal\"* running on the robot computer.  Text to the right of the `@` tells us the name of the remote computer (`dia-waffleX`), and text to the left of `@` tells us the name of the user that we are logged in as (`waffle` in this case)\n",
    "1. Then launch `tmux` to make the remote terminal a bit easier to work with:  \n",
    "**[TERMINAL 1]:** `tmux`  \n",
    "Any text in the terminal should now clear and a green banner should appear across the bottom of the window indicating that a *tmux* session is active.  We'll call this terminal window **[TERMINAL 1][TMUX 0]** from here on in \n",
    "1. To get ROS up and running we need to launch the *ROS master* in a new terminal **on the laptop**.  Open up a **new terminal window** on the laptop using `CTRL+ALT+T` (which we'll call **[TERMINAL 2]**)\n",
    "1. Use `roscore` to launch the ROS master:  \n",
    "**[TERMINAL 2]:** `roscore`  \n",
    "A terminal message ending as follows:  \n",
    "        started core services [/rosout]  \n",
    "indicates that the ROS Master has been launched successfully  \n",
    "1. Then we need to launch all the core *ROS packages* on the robot.  Return to **[TERMINAL 1][TMUX 0]** and enter the following:  \n",
    "**[TERMINAL 1][TMUX 0]:** `roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_robot.launch`  \n",
    "Once you see the following text:  \n",
    "        Calibration End  \n",
    "then the robot core packages are up and running\n",
    "1. Next, go to **[TERMINAL 2]** and create a new tab using the `CTRL+SHIFT+T` keyboard shortcut (we'll call this new tab **[TERMINAL 2][TAB 2]**)  \n",
    "1. Finally, we need to launch some more *ROS packages* **on the laptop**, so in the new tab you have just created, enter the following:  \n",
    "**[TERMINAL 2][TAB 2]:** `roslaunch turtlebot3_bringup turtlebot3_remote.launch`  \n",
    "The following message should appear to indicate that the remote packages on the *laptop* have been launched sucessfully:  \n",
    "        process[robot_state_publisher-1]: started with pid [xxxx]  \n",
    "\n",
    "**The connection between our robot and the laptop is now established, *ROS master* is up and running on the laptop, and a number of *ROS Nodes* have been launched on both the robot and laptop, so the TurtleBot3 Robot is now ready to go!**"

    "    1. Press and hold the left mouse button and a large green arrow will appear  \n",
    "    1. Whilst still holding down the left mouse button, rotate the green arrow to match the direction of the robot within the map  \n",
    "    1. Let go of the left mouse button to set the initial robot pose.  If you've done it correctly, the real-time LiDAR data should now match with the background map, if not then have another go<img src=\"figures/nav12.png\">  \n",
    "1. We then need to move the robot around a bit to gather some more information about the environment so that the robot can determine it's actual position more accurately.  \n",
    "**Note:** *The cloud of small green arrows around the robot shows where the robot thinks it is.  We need to reduce the scatter in this by moving the robot around a bit.*  \n",
    "Move the robot around using the bluetooth controller until the particle cloud begins to converge underneath the robot<img src=\"figures/nav3.png\">  \n",

    "    1. Click and hold the left mouse button and a large green arrow will appear again, the base of the arrow is the *position goal*  \n",
    "    1. Whilst still holding the left mouse button, rotate the green arrow around to set the desired *orientation goal* for the robot  \n",
    "    1. Release the mouse button to set the goal, and watch the robot try to navigate to the destination on it's own!"
